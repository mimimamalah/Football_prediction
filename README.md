# Football prediction
**Personal Project for Artificial Intelligence Course**  

## Abstract
This report details a personal project undertaken as part of an Artificial Intelligence course, focusing on the application of Machine Learning techniques to predict the standings and match outcomes of the 2021-2022 English Premier League season. Leveraging neural network models, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Deep Neural Network(DNN) and le Net the study analyzes data from seasons 2007-2008 to 2020-2021, comparing model performances against na√Øve predictions. The MLP model emerged as the most promising for predicting final standings.
